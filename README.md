This project is a demo - proof of concept (work still in progress) - on using dojo mobile,
 dgrid fetching data from formhub.

* ['dgrid'](https://github.com/SitePen/dgrid)
* [xstyle](https://github.com/kriszyp/xstyle)
* [put-selector](https://github.com/kriszyp/put-selector)
* [The Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org) SDK version 1.7
    * Out of the DTK components, Dojo core is the only hard dependency for dgrid;
      however, some of the test pages also use components from Dijit, and
      Dojox (namely grid for a comparison test, and mobile for a mobile page).

Place the following directories in the js folder.

* `dgrid`
* `dijit`
* `dojo`
* `dojox`
* `put-selector`
* `xstyle`
